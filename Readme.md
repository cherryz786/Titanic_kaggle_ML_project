Titanic Machine Learning Project
Titanic

This repository contains the code and data for my Titanic Machine Learning project, which is based on the famous Kaggle competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster". The goal of this project is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features like age, sex, ticket class, etc.

About the Kaggle Competition
The "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" competition on Kaggle is one of the most popular introductory machine learning competitions. The dataset used in this competition contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. The challenge is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine if a given passenger survived or not.

Data Description
The dataset contains the following variables:

Survival: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Sex: Sex of the passenger
Age: Age in years (fractional if less than 1, in the form of xx.5 if estimated)
SibSp: Number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents / children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Variable Notes
Pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)

1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower
Age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, it is in the form of xx.5.

SibSp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...

Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)
Parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...

Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children traveled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

data: This folder contains the datasets used for training and testing the machine learning models.
notebooks: This directory includes Jupyter notebooks where the data exploration, feature engineering, and model training are performed.
src: This directory contains the source code of the machine learning models.
models: This folder stores the trained models that have been saved for future use.
results: This directory holds the evaluation results and any other project-related outputs.
requirements.txt: This file lists the required Python libraries and their versions to run the project.
README.md: You are currently reading this file, which provides an overview of the project.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-machine-learning.git
cd titanic-machine-learning
Install the required dependencies using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory to explore the data, perform feature engineering, and train the machine learning models.

After training the models, you can use them to make predictions on new data or the test set from Kaggle.
